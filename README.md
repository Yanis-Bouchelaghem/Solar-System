# Solar-System
Welcome to the Solar System Simulation! This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system using C++ and OpenGL.

## Features
- Accurate representation of the orbits and positions of the planets in the solar system
- Ability to control the camera and view the solar system from different perspectives
- Option to view the solar system in real-time or fast-forward time
- Solar system information displayed on the screen, including the names and distances of the planets from the sun

## Dependencies
- C++11
- OpenGL
- GLUT
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics Library)

## Building and Running
To build the project, make sure you have the dependencies installed and then run the following command:


## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to move the camera around the solar system
- Use the + and - keys to zoom in and out
- Use the r key to reset the camera to the default position
- Use the t key to toggle between real-time and fast-forward mode

## Credits
Data on the planets and their orbits was obtained from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory website
